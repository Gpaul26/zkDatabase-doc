## Retrieving a List of Collections

The zkDatabase library provides the `collectionList` method to retrieve a list of all collections within a specified database. This function is particularly useful for administrators and developers looking to understand the database structure, inspect available collections, or perform batch operations across multiple collections.

### Definition

The `collectionList` function is called on a database object, and it returns a promise that resolves to an array of collections.

```typescript
await zkdb.db(databaseName: string).collectionList(): Promise<string[]>;
```

### Parameters

- None

### Returns

The `collectionList` method returns a `Promise` that resolves to an array of `string`. Each string represents the name of a collection within the specified database. This list provides insights into the database's structure and can help in planning further operations or analyses.

### Example

Here is an example demonstrating how to retrieve the list of collections from a specified database:

<DatabaseExample
  auth={true}
  code={`\nawait zkdb.db('zkdb_test').collectionList()`}
/>

This snippet, when executed, retrieves all collection names from the `zkdb_test` database.

### Expected Output

The result of the `collectionList` method will be an array containing the names of collections or detailed information about each collection, depending on the implementation specifics. For example:

```javascript
Collections in zkdb_test: [
  'users',
  'products',
  'orders',
  // ...other collection names
]
```
