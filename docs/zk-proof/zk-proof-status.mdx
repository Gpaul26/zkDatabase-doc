# Get zkProofStatus

The `zkProofStatus` method is used to retrieve the current status of a database's zk proof. This method helps track the progress of proof generation or identify any issues that may have occurred during the process.

#### Method Signature

```ts
await zkdb.db(databaseName: string).zkProofStatus(): Promise<TZkProofStatusResponse>;
```

#### Syntax

<DatabaseExample
  auth={true}
  code={`\nconsole.log(await zkdb.db("zkdb_test").zkProofStatus());`}
/>

#### Returns

- A promise that resolves to a `TZkProofStatusResponse`.

The `TZkProofStatusResponse` enum contains the following structure:

##### **TZkProofResponse**

| **Status**   | **Description**                                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Queued`     | The proof request has been queued and is waiting to be processed.         |
| `Processing` | The proof request is currently being processed.                           |
| `Failed`     | The proof request has failed due to an error or issue during generation.  |
| `Success`    | The proof request has successfully completed and is ready for retrieval.  |
| `Unknown`    | `The proof request status is unknown, possibly due to an zkProof is null. |
