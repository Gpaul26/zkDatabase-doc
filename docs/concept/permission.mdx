# Permission

## Overview

The zkDatabase Permission System is inspired by the GNU/Linux file system's permission model. It divides users into three primary categories: `owner`, `group`, and `other`, each with distinct permission sets. This structure allows for fine-grained control over access to documents and collections, enabling efficient management of security and access rights.

### Permission Model Breakdown

#### 1. Owner

- The `owner` of a document or collection has the highest level of control.
- Owners can configure, modify, or delete the document/collection.

#### 2. Group

- A `group` is a set of users who share the same permission configuration.
- The group can have restricted or extended access based on how permissions are configured for that group.

#### 3. Other

- The `other` category includes all users who do not belong to either the `owner` or the `group`.
- These users have the most limited permissions and can only access documents/collections as permitted by the system.

## Permission Types

Permissions are defined at different levels based on user types (`owner`, `group`, and `other`). These are the core permission fields:

- **Read**: The ability to view or retrieve the content of the document/collection.
- **Write**: The ability to modify or update the content.
- **Delete**: The ability to remove the document/collection.
- **System**: Special permissions related to system-level operations, such as management tasks.

### Permissions Order

The **order** of permissions in the zkDatabase Permission System affects the bit positions in the permission value, which is stored as a bitmask. Each permission type is assigned a specific order and corresponds to a bit in the permission number:

- **Read**: Order 0 (bit 0)
- **Write**: Order 1 (bit 1)
- **Delete**: Order 2 (bit 2)
- **System**: Order 3 (bit 3)

### How It Works with Bitwise Operations:

- **Setting a permission**: Use the bitwise OR (`|`) operator to set a specific bit. For example, to enable **Write** permission, use:
  ```ts
  permission = permission | (1 << 1); // Enable Write
  ```
- **Checking a permission**: Use the bitwise AND (`&`) operator. For example, to check if **Delete** is enabled:
  ```ts
  hasDeletePermission = (permission & (1 << 2)) !== 0; // Check Delete
  ```
- **Disabling a permission**: Use bitwise AND with negation (`~`) to clear a bit. For example, to disable **System** permission:
  ```ts
  permission = permission & ~(1 << 3); // Disable System
  ```

The order determines the bit's position in the bitmask, making permission checks and modifications efficient.

## Permission Model Structure

### Types and Constants

- **PermissionType**: Refers to the three user categories — `owner`, `group`, and `other`.
- **OwnershipType**: Specifies the ownership categories — `owner` and `group`.
- **PermissionField**: Represents the different permission types available — `write`, `read`, `delete`, `system`.

### PermissionRecord

Permissions are recorded using a boolean value for each of the permission fields. The `PermissionRecord` type maps permission types to boolean values, where each field (write, read, delete, system) is either enabled or disabled.

```typescript
type PermissionRecord = {
  [k in PermissionRecordKey]: boolean;
};
```

### PermissionDetail

The `PermissionDetail` type aggregates `PermissionRecord` for each user category — `owner`, `group`, and `other`.

```typescript
type PermissionDetail = {
  [key in PermissionType]: PermissionRecord;
};
```

### Ownership and Permissions

The `Ownership` type represents who owns the document or collection, while `OwnershipAndPermission` combines ownership with a numeric permission value. The permission value is a bitmask, where different bits represent various permissions.

```typescript
type Ownership = {
  [key in OwnershipType]: string;
};
```

## Setting Permissions

### Setting Permissions for Each User Type

Permissions can be configured for `owner`, `group`, and `other` individually. Each permission (read, write, delete, system) is set as `true` or `false` for each category.

For instance, setting the `write` permission for the `owner`:

```typescript
permission.owner.write = true;
```

### Combining Permissions

Permissions can be combined using a bitwise OR operation. The `combine()` method allows the merging of two permission sets.

```typescript
const combinedPermission = permission1.combine(permission2);
```

## Predefined Policies

zkDatabase includes predefined policies for common scenarios:

### 1. **Strict Policy**

Gives full control to the `owner`, and no access to `group` and `other`.

```typescript
static policyStrict(): Permission {
  return Permission.from({
    owner: { read: true, write: true, delete: true, system: true },
  });
}
```

### 2. **Private Policy**

The `owner` has full access, while the `group` has only read access, and `other` has no permissions.

```typescript
static policyPrivate(): Permission {
  return Permission.from({
    owner: { read: true, write: true, delete: true, system: true },
    group: { read: true, write: false, delete: false, system: false },
  });
}
```

### 3. **Public Policy**

The `owner` has full access, the `group` can read and write, and `other` can only read.

```typescript
static policyPublic(): Permission {
  return Permission.from({
    owner: { read: true, write: true, delete: true, system: true },
    group: { read: true, write: true, delete: false, system: false },
    other: { read: true, write: false, delete: false, system: false },
  });
}
```

## Example Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Collaborative Project

- **Owner**: A user who creates and fully controls a document.
- **Group**: A team of users who can view and edit the document, but cannot delete it.
- **Other**: General users who can only view the document.

**Solution**: Set up the `owner` with full permissions, the `group` with read and write access, and `other` with only read permissions using the `policyPublic()`.

### Scenario 2: Private Data Sharing

- **Owner**: A user who maintains complete control over the document.
- **Group**: A set of users who are allowed to view the document but not modify it.
- **Other**: No access.

**Solution**: Set up the `owner` with full permissions, the `group` with read-only access, and `other` with no access using the `policyPrivate()`.

## Best Practices

- **Minimize Permission Exposure**: Only grant `other` permissions when necessary to reduce the exposure of sensitive data.
- **Use Groups Wisely**: Ensure that permissions for the `group` are appropriately set to avoid unintentional privilege escalation.
- **Regular Audits**: Regularly review permissions for documents and collections to ensure they align with current business needs.

## Security Considerations

- **Bitwise Protection**: By using bitwise operations, the system ensures efficient and secure permission checks, preventing unauthorized access.
- **Granular Control**: The system allows fine-grained control over what each user can do with a document or collection.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Not Applying Correctly**: Ensure that the permissions are correctly set for the intended user category (owner, group, other).
2. **Permissions Overridden**: Check if a policy or permission inheritance is overriding your settings.
3. **Access Denied Despite Correct Permissions**: Double-check for typos or misconfigurations in the permission setup. Ensure the correct permission fields are enabled.
