# Getting Started

Welcome to zkDatabase, a cutting-edge NoSQL database designed by Orochi Network to provide provable data integrity utilizing Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). This guide will help you get started with setting up and using zkDatabase.

## Requirement

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Hardware: A machine with at least 8GBs of RAM.
- Operating System: Linux, macOS, or Windows.
- Dependencies:

  - Node.js(v18 or later)
  - npm (v10 or later) or Yarn (legacy mode)
  - `o1js` package, `^1.9.1` is recommended
  - `mina-signer` package `3.0.7` or [Auro Wallet](https://www.aurowallet.com/)

A basic understanding of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), the `o1js` library, and NoSQL databases

## Installation

zkDatabase SDK is provided as [a npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zkdb), you need to install the zkDatabase SDK in your project:

```bash
npm install zkdb
```

or

```bash
yarn add zkdb
```

This command initializes your project with the necessary dependencies to interact with zkDatabase as a Service.

## Start using zkDatabase

### Setup your credentials

zkDatabase support both `node` and browser `environment`, in browser you may need to install the wallet that support Mina Provider like [Auro Wallet](https://www.aurowallet.com/). In `Node.js` you have to specify the private that's generated by `mina-singer`:

```ts
import Client from "mina-signer";

const minaSigner = new Client({
  network: "testnet",
});

console.log(minaSigner.genKeys().privateKey);
```

Result:

```

### Connect to zkDatabase endpoint

To start interacting with zkDatabase you must connect to its endpoint. You can do this by providing the necessary credentials such as username, private key, environment, and URL.

From now on, assumed that we have an instance of zkDatabase and it called `zkdb`.
