# Get Verification Key

The `verificationKey` method allows you to retrieve important verification keys associated with specific contracts in the database. These keys include details like the Merkle tree height, key hashes, and raw encoded data. They are essential for verifying zero-knowledge proofs and understanding the cryptographic configuration of the system.

#### Method Signature

```ts
verificationKey(): Promise<VerificationKey | null>;
```

#### Syntax

<DatabaseExample
  auth={true}
  code={`\nconsole.log(await zkdb.db("zkdb_test").verificationKey());`}
/>

#### Returns

- A promise that resolves to a [`VerificationKey`](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps/o1js-reference/classes/VerificationKey) or `null` if no verification keys are available.

```typescript
{
  data: 'AQHwbVNVDjA...m0fMy4=',
  hash: Field { value: [ 0, [Array] ] }
}

```
