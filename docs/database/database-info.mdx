# Get Database Information

The `info` method allows you to retrieve important settings related to a specific database, including the public key and Merkle tree height. These settings are crucial for understanding the cryptographic configuration of the database.

#### Syntax

<DatabaseExample
  auth={true}
  code={`\nconsole.log(await zkdb.db("zkdb_test").info());`}
/>

#### Returns

- A promise that resolves to a `TDatabaseInfoResponse` object containing the database's public key and Merkle tree height.

```json
{
  "databaseName": "zkdb_test",
  "databaseOwner": "chiro-user",
  "merkleHeight": 64,
  "appPublicKey": "",
  "sizeOnDisk": null,
  "deployStatus": "Unknown"
}
```
